//Create an object called Multiplier with two methods: multiply and getCurrentValue. 
//multiply should initially return the number supplied * 1 and from then on whatever 
//the current value is times the number supplied.getCurrentValue should return the last 
//nswer returned from multiply.



//Implement an object model that allows you to store strings that represent a 
//photo. Your model should include an Album object that can contain many 
//Photo objects in its photos attribute. Each Album should allow you to add 
//a new photo, list all photos, and access a specific photo by the order it 
//was added. Each Photo should store the photo's file name and the location 
//the photo was taken in as strings. Create instances of each object defined
// to prove that your object model works.
